# video processing and application
## TP1 problem:
TP1 is about video segmentation, comparing two methods, GMM and Optical flow. The detailed info, please click the link: [TP1 questions](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Video-Processing/blob/master/TP1/INF6803_H2018_TP1_EN_v2.pdf)

This dataset including 1700 frames, which is on the baseline of highway.zip. Website link: [Dataset](http://jacarini.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/dataset2012/)

I wrote two methods: GMM(Gaussian Mixture model). Code: [GMM](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Video-Processing/blob/master/TP1/INF6803_TP1_PART1.m)

one is Optical flow. Code:[Optical flow](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Video-Processing/blob/master/TP1/INF6803_TP1_PART2.m)

The detailed implementation and analysis is on report. [Report](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Video-Processing/blob/master/TP1/tp1-inf6803-video.pdf)
